Once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed. The methods toLowerCase,
toUpperCase, trim, replace , replaceFirst, and replaceAll return a new string
derived from the original string (without changing the original string!). The toLowerCase
and toUpperCase methods return a new string by converting all the characters in the string
to lowercase or uppercase. The trim method returns a new string by eliminating blank char-
acters from both ends of the string. Several versions of the replace methods are provided to
replace a character or a substring in the string with a new character or a new substring.
